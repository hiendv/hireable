## But why?
Some of my friends want to embed the employment status into their open-source projects.
But it takes too much time and effort to keep these information up-to-date across your projects.  
I thought it would be much cooler to tell people whether you're hireable or not with a badge. Isn't it? :confused:

## The badges
![Hireable](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hiendv/hireable/master/src/styles/default/yes.svg)
![Not hireable](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hiendv/hireable/master/src/styles/default/no.svg)
![Error](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hiendv/hireable/master/src/styles/default/error.svg)

I was too lazy to implement [badges/shields specification](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/spec/SPECIFICATION.md)  
No on-the-fly generated badges for now, I guess. They are all pre-generated. 

- Q: **How do you know when I'm hireable?**  
A: Your [GitHub jobs profile](https://github.com/settings/profile#user_profile_hireable)

- Q: **Cache expiration**  
A: GitHub has their own image proxy: [camo](https://help.github.com/articles/why-do-my-images-have-strange-urls/). Hireable caching is flexible, see [Configurations](#configurations)
